        <h1>Netflix Terms of Use</h1>
        <p>Netflix provides a personalized subscription service that allows our members to access entertainment content
            (“Netflix content”) over the Internet on certain Internet-connected TVs, computers and other devices
            ("Netflix ready devices").

            These Terms of Use govern your use of our service. As used in these Terms of Use, "Netflix service", "our
            service" or "the service" means the personalized service provided by Netflix for discovering and accessing
            Netflix content, including all features and functionalities, recommendations and reviews, our websites, and
            user interfaces, as well as all content and software associated with our service. References to ‘you’ in
            these Terms of Use indicate the member who created the Netflix account and whose payment method is charged.
        </p>
        <h2>1. Membership</h2>
        <p>1.1. Your Netflix membership will continue until terminated. To use the Netflix service you must have
            Internet access and a Netflix ready device, and provide us with one or more Payment Methods. “Payment
            Method” means a current, valid, accepted method of payment, as may be updated from time to time, and which
            may include payment through your account with a third party. Unless you cancel your membership before your
            billing date, you authorize us to charge the subscription fee for the next billing cycle to your Payment
            Method (see "Cancellation" below).
            1.2. We may offer a number of subscription plans, including subscriptions offered by third parties in
            conjunction with the provision of their own products and services. We are not responsible for the products
            and services provided by such third parties. Some subscription plans may have differing conditions and
            limitations, which will be disclosed at your sign-up or in other communications made available to you. You
            can find specific details regarding your Netflix subscription by visiting the netflix.com website and
            clicking on the "Account" link available at the top of the pages under your profile name.</p>
        <h2>Promotional Offers.</h2>
        <p> We may from time to time offer special promotional offers, plans or memberships (“Offers”). Offer
            eligibility is determined by Netflix at its sole discretion and we reserve the right to revoke an Offer and
            put your account on hold in the event that we determine you are not eligible. Members of households with an
            existing or recent Netflix membership may not be eligible for certain introductory Offers. We may use
            information such as device ID, method of payment or an account email address used with an existing or recent
            Netflix membership to determine Offer eligibility. The eligibility requirements and other limitations and
            conditions will be disclosed when you sign-up for the Offer or in other communications made available to
            you.
